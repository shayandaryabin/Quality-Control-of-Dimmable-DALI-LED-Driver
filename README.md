# Quality-Control-of-Dimmable-DALI-LED-Driver
• Create a MEAS class to get the measured OUTPUT electrical parameters of
LED-Module through oscilloscope

• Create a DUT class to get the measured OUTPUT electrical parameters of
LED-Module through DALI LED-Driver

• Create a TEST calss to compare the MEAS and DUT values, the DUT values
must be within +/-5% of MEAS

• Developed a Python Code in Pycharm IDE using Pytest framework to return
the Pass/Fail results

Key Achievement

Developed test automation to verify the functionality of test
setup.
