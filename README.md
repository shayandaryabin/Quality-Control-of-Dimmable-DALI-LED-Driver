# Quality-Control-of-Dimmable-DALI-LED-Driver
Create a MEAS class to get the measured OUTPUT electrical parameters of
LED-Module through oscilloscope

Create a DUT class to get the measured OUTPUT electrical parameters of
LED-Module through DALI LED-Driver

Create a TEST calss to compare the MEAS and DUT values, the DUT values
must be within +/-5% of MEAS

Developed a Python Code in Pycharm IDE using Pytest framework to return
the Pass/Fail results

The measured values through oscilloscope or other electrical measurement devices represent the values in i_MEAS and u_MEAS in data.json file.

Key Achievement: Developed test automation to verify the functionality of test
setup.
